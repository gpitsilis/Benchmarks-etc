# CPU-benchmark

This is a simple benchmark which demonstrates the computing capability of the CPU/FPU of you computer.
If you run it in a machine with older CPU (e.g. an 15 year old AMD Athlon XP ) you will notice that it can still
outperform the newer multicore CPUs despite their higher clock rate !!!
